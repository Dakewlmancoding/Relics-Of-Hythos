# Relics-Of-Hythos
In the Dwarven capital of Khar'ezor, the somewhat deranged wizard Fulminis Braccae has hired each of you to help him retrieve a legendary sword known as ‘Evil’s Bane.’ 
Have players say how they met Fulminis
Over the past 3 days, he has led you to an ancient place which he refers to as “The cave of Forgotten.” In your travels with him, he reveals that he believes this sword to be part of an ancient prophecy about uniting the magic of old with the magic of new and wants the artifact to research. 

Your party has just arrived at a somewhat large hill, where Fulminis instructed you to set up camp. While you were doing that, Fulminis was running frantically about the hill, carrying some sort of map, muttering inaudibly to himself as he looked between the hill and the map. 


Welcome to the Demo (POC, really) for The Relics of Hythos! This is a DnD campaign I've been running for a year or so, and I've decided to try and turn it into a full on game using Python and Panda3D!
This demo contains the first puzzle of the adventure and is nowhere near completed!
